# Isometric Renders
Isometric Renders allows you to take isometric screenshots, or rather, create renders of game objects like parts of world, blocks, items and entities.
These are automatically keyed to have a transparent background and you can adjust scale, positioning and many more options right in-game in a fancy gui.
This was designed with modded wikis or similar documentation in mind, should be easy to use and mostly pretty performant.

**In-Depth documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/glisco03/isometric-renders/wiki)**
